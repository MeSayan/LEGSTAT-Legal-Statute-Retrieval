The Land Acquisition Officer offered a compensation of Rs. 30,000 per hectare (Rs. 3 per square metre) for irrigated lands and Rs. 20,000 (Rs. 2 per square metre) for non-irrigated lands. The owners of the lands which are to be acquired under the said notifications demands a compensaton of Rs. 40 per square metre. The Reference Court determined the market value of the lands to be Rs. 25 per square metre. However, it did not pay interest on the amounts payable by way of additional amount and solatium.
